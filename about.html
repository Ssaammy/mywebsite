    <h3>PERSONAL LIFE</h3>

    <p>Relationships and marriages
     Downey started dating actress Sarah Jessica Parker in 1984 after meeting her on the set of Firstborn. They were both 18 and moved in together after eight weeks of dating. The couple separated eight years later, in 1991, due to his drug addiction.
    Downey married actress and singer Deborah Falconer on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship. They had only know each other for six weeks before marrying. Their son was born in September 1993. The strain on their marriage from Downey's repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 1996, Falconer left Downey and filed for divorce in early 2001, citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason. Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce in 2004, with Falconer gaining custody of their son.</p>

    n 2003, Downey met producer Susan Levin, an executive vice president of production at Joel Silver's film company, Silver Pictures, on the set of Gothika. Though Susan twice turned down his romantic advances, she and Downey did quietly strike up a romance during production. Despite Susan's worries that the romance would not last after the completion of shooting given that "he's an actor; I have a real job," the couple's relationship continued after production wrapped on Gothika, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her thirty-first birthday. In August 2005, the couple were married in a Jewish ceremony at Amagansett, New York. A tattoo on one of his biceps reads "Suzie Q" in tribute to her. The Downeys' first child, a son, was born in February 2012, and their second, a daughter, was born in November 2014.</p>

    <p>Downey has been a close friend of Mel Gibson since they starred in Air America. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding The Passion of the Christ and said "nobody's perfect" in reference to Gibson's 2006 DUI. Gibson said of Downey: "He was one of the first people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'" In October 2011, Downey was honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards. Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.</p>

     <h4>CAREER</h4>
    </header>
     <p>Robert Downey Jr. began his career in theater in the early 1980s and quickly moved into film, gaining attention with roles in movies like *Weird Science* and *Less than Zero*. His performance in *Chaplin* (1992) earned him an Academy Award nomination. However, his career faced significant setbacks due to drug addiction, leading to multiple arrests and stints in rehab between 1996 and 2001.
     During his time in rehabilitation, Downey's career stalled, but he made a major comeback with the TV series *Ally McBeal*, winning a Golden Globe for his role. However, legal issues continued to impact his career, leading to his firing from the show in 2001.
     After hitting rock bottom, Downey entered long-term recovery and made a successful return to acting, starting with the music video for *I Want Love* in 2001 and later starring in films like *Gothika*, *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, and *A Scanner Darkly*. His career reached new heights in 2008 with his roles in *Iron Man* and *Tropic Thunder*, both commercially successful films. His portrayal of Tony Stark in *Iron Man* solidified his status as a Hollywood A-lister.
     Downey continued to appear in major films such as *Sherlock Holmes*, *The Avengers* series, and *Iron Man 3*, leading up to *Avengers: Endgame* in 2019. In 2020, he starred in *Dolittle*, which was a box office disappointment. However, his performance in *Oppenheimer* (2023) was critically acclaimed, earning him numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
     In addition to acting, Downey has expanded his career into hosting, starring in *Downey's Dream Cars* (2023), and working on projects like *The Sympathizer* (2024). He is also set to return to the MCU as Doctor Doom in upcoming films and has made his Broadway debut in *McNeal* in 2024.</p>

     <h5>SOBRIETY</h5>
    </header>
    <p>Downey says he has been drug-free since July 2003 and credits his wife with helping him overcome his drug and alcohol habits, along with his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery programs, yoga, and the practice of Wing Chun kung fu, the martial art he learned from Eric Oram, who is also a fight consultant in several of Downey's movies. Oram was Downey's personal fight coordinator in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Captain America: Civil War. In December 2015, Downey was chosen as one of 91 people to be pardoned by the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, for his prior drug offenses. The pardon does not erase Downey's criminal record, but it does allow him to serve on a jury. Oram wrote a letter in support of Downey's pardon to Governor Brown. When asked on The Oprah Winfrey Show how he was able to make his sobriety stick this time, Downey said, "It's really not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems. What's hard is to decide to do it."</p>
